# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** Fast, reliable on-trip access to documents, packing list, and today's activities — a traveler on the ground must be able to pull up their passport scan, check off packing items, and see what's next without friction.

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation + Trips)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SwiftData `VersionedSchema` must be established in Phase 1 before any model ships — retrofitting it post-release is the highest-cost pitfall
- [Roadmap]: Documents before Activities because `FileStorageService` proven in Phase 2 is reused for activity photos in Phase 7
- [Roadmap]: Activity notifications and photos split into dedicated phases (5 and 7) to keep Activity CRUD stable before layering services
- [Roadmap revision]: Polish + TestFlight moved to Phase 6 (before Activity Photos) so the TestFlight build ships with a stable, locked-down core; photo attachment follows as Phase 7

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 research flag: VisionKit coordinator lifecycle and iOS 18 `@ModelActor`-to-main-context merge pattern are confirmed bug territories — consider running `/gsd-research-phase` before planning Phase 2
